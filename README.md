# Basic-Stripe-Ecommerce

A simple ecommerce website that uses Stripe to process payments. Based on a Udemy course.

I've added a lot of comments to the code. I hope the community can benefit from it.


*The HTML and CSS style comes from course repo:* https://bitbucket.org/ynca99/django2_shopping_cart.git.
